# Predicting a Cancer Patient's Survival Using Natural Language Processing with their First Oncologist Document

By John-Jose Nunez

For the forthcoming paper:  [Title](https://url)

Implementation of NLP methods to predict cancer needs and survival using physician documents. Most of the data processing and selection
was done in the scar_nlp_data and scar repos, also located on my Github. 

Loosely based on the hedwig NLP repo, but starting fresh due to the large changes
in  PyTorch 1.9.0 and especially torchtext 0.10.0

Forked from the Github repo used for my thesis, jjnunez\scar_nlp

# Training/Fine-tuning NLP Models

Models are ran as python modules. Arguments can be based through the command line. E.g.

python -m cnn --target "need_emots_1" --batch-size 16

See [models](./models) for the various deployed models. 

See [trainers](./trainers) for the trainers used to train the models

See [evaluators](./evaluators) for the code used to evaluate models

For training the models on windows, .bat files are provided that contain the command-line code,
as found in the [bats](./bats) folder. 

# Visualizing and Understanding Models

See the [viz](./viz) folder for jupyter notebooks used to visualize and understand how are 
models are trained and fine-tuned.
